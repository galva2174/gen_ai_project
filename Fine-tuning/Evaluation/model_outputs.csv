What is supervised learning?,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping between input data and the corresponding output labels, so the algorithm can make predictions on new, unseen data.",Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
What is unsupervised learning?,"Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data. The goal is to discover patterns, relationships, or structure in the data without any prior knowledge of the correct output.",Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model finds patterns in data without labeled responses.
What is overfitting?,"Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too complex and performs extremely well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. This happens when the model is too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to other data.","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on new data."
What is underfitting?,"Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and new data.",Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
What is a decision tree?,A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model to classify data or make predictions. It works by recursively partitioning the data into smaller subsets based on the values of input features.,A decision tree is a model that makes decisions by splitting data into branches based on feature values.
What is a neural network?,A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs and produce outputs through a series of transformations.,A neural network is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain consisting of interconnected layers of nodes.
What is a feature in machine learning?,"A feature in machine learning is an individual attribute or characteristic of the data that is used as input to a model. Features can be categorical, numerical, or textual, and are used to describe the data points.",A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic used as input to a machine learning model.
What is a label in machine learning?,A label in machine learning is the correct output or response associated with a particular input data point.,A label is the target value or output that a machine learning model is trained to predict.
What is cross-validation?,Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by training and testing it on multiple subsets of the available data.,Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how a model will generalize to an independent dataset by splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times.
What is the difference between classification and regression?,"Classification is a type of supervised learning where the target variable is categorical, and the goal is to predict a class label or category that an instance belongs to.",Classification predicts discrete categories while regression predicts continuous values.
What is a confusion matrix?,"A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted classes against the actual classes, providing insights into the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.",A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by showing true and false predictions for each class.
What is accuracy in machine learning?,Accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It is calculated as the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances.,Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions made by a model out of all predictions.
What is precision?,"Precision is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly in cases where the classes are imbalanced. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.",Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
What is recall?,"Recall is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly in cases where the classes are imbalanced. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.",Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positives in the data.
What is F1-score?,The F1-score is a metric that combines precision and recall to provide a balanced measure of a classification model's performance. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.,F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall providing a balance between the two.
What is a hyperparameter?,"A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before training a machine learning model. In other words, hyperparameters are parameters that are tuned or adjusted prior to training a model, as opposed to model parameters, which are learned during training. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers in a neural network.",A hyperparameter is a configuration value set before training a model such as learning rate or number of trees.
What is gradient descent?,"Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning. It's an iterative process that adjusts the model parameters to find the values that result in the lowest possible loss. In each iteration, the algorithm calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters and updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. This process is repeated until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.",Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively updating model parameters.
What is regularization?,"Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights or complex models. This penalty term encourages the model to learn simpler, more generalizable patterns, reducing overfitting.",Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function.
What is a support vector machine?,"A support vector machine (SVM) is a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. SVMs aim to find a decision boundary (or hyperplane) that maximally separates the classes in the feature space. The algorithm identifies the most informative data points, called support vectors, which lie closest to the decision boundary.",A support vector machine is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression by finding the optimal separating hyperplane.
What is k-means clustering?,K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning the data into k clusters based on their similarities. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the centroids of the clusters and reassigning the data points to the cluster with the closest centroid.,K-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on feature similarity.
